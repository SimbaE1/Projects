# PicarX
_I am using the Sunfounder PicarX with a Rasberry Pi 5._

The Mahler file is not in this repository, but is a recording of Pierre Boulez conducting Mahler Symphony No. 6.

The purpose of this is to interact with the PicarX.

I have found it is pretty good at chess, but starts forgetting position in the middlegame.

##DOES WORK

Give it an alphabet substitution or ceaser cipher and it will figure it out. Preferably 200+ char. Try not to use names or urls, as that trips it up for now.

SCAR: {SARCASTICALLY OVERJOYED} WHY! IF IT ISN'T MY BIG BROTHER DESCENDING FROM ON HIGH TO MINGLE WITH THE COMMONERS.
MUFASA: SARABI AND I DIDN'T SEE YOU AT THE PRESENTATION OF SIMBA.
SCAR: {FAKING ASTONISHMENT} THAT WAS TODAY? OH, I FEEL SIMPLY AWFUL.
SCAR: {ADMIRING HIS CLAWS} ...MUST HAVE SLIPPED MY MIND.
ZAZU: YES, WELL, AS SLIPPERY AS YOUR MIND IS, AS THE KING'S BROTHER, YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRST IN LINE! SCAR: WELL, I WAS FIRST IN LINE, ... UNTIL THE LITTLE HAIRBALL WAS BORN.
MUFASA: THAT “HAIRBALL” IS MY SON -AND YOUR FUTURE KING.
SCAR: OHH, I SHALL PRACTICE MY CURTSY.
MUFASA: {MENACING} DON'T TURN YOUR BACK ON ME, SCAR.
SCAR: {LOOKING BACK} ON, NO, MUFASA. PERHAPS YOU SHOULDN'T TURN YOUR BACK ON ME.
MUFASA: (ROARS) IS THAT A CHALLENGE?
SCAR: TEMPER, TEMPER. I WOULDN'T DREAM OF CHALLENGING YOU.
ZAZU: PITY! WHY NOT?
SCAR: WELL, AS FAR AS BRAINS GO, I GOT THE LION'S SHARE. BUT, WHEN IT COMES TO BRUTE STRENGTH {LOOKING AT MUFASA} ...I'M AFRAID I'M AT THE SHALLOW END OF THE GENE POOL.
 
ZAZU: {DEEP SIGH} THERE'S ONE IN EVERY FAMILY SIRE... TWO IN MINE ACTUALLY. AND THEY ALWAYS MANAGE TO RUIN SPECIAL OCCASIONS.
MUFASA: WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH HIM?
ZAZU: HE'D MAKE A VERY HANDSOME THROW RUG.
MUFASA: {CHIDING} ZAZU!
ZAZU: AND JUST THINK! WHENEVER HE GETS DIRTY, YOU COULD TAKE HIM OUT AND BEAT HIM. {THEY EXIT CHUCKLING.) – CLOSE CURTAIN

MUFASA: A KING'S TIME AS RULER RISES AND FALLS LIKE THE SUN. ONE DAY SIMBA, THE SUN WILL SET ON MY TIME HERE AND WILL RISE WITH YOU AS THE NEW KING.
SIMBA: AND THIS’LL ALL BE MINE?
MUFASA: EVERYTHING.
SIMBA: EVERYTHING THE LIGHT TOUCHES... {SIMBA LOOKS ALL AROUND) WHAT ABOUT THAT SHADOWY PLACE?
MUFASA: THAT'S BEYOND OUR BORDERS; YOU MUST NEVER GO THERE, SIMBA.
SIMBA: BUT I THOUGHT A KING CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS.
MUFASA: OH, THERE'S MORE TO BEING KING THAN-- GETTING YOUR WAY ALL THE TIME.
SIMBA: {AWED} THERE'S MORE?
MUFASA: {CHUCKLES} SIMBA.
MUFASA: EVERYTHING YOU SEE EXISTS TOGETHER, IN A DELICATE BALANCE. AS KING, YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT BALANCE, AND RESPECT ALL THE CREATURES-- FROM THE CRAWLING ANT TO THE LEAPING ANTELOPE.
SIMBA: BUT, DAD, DON'T WE EAT THE ANTELOPE?
MUFASA: YES, SIMBA, BUT LET ME EXPLAIN. WHEN WE DIE, OUR BODIES BECOME THE GRASS. AND THE ANTELOPE EAT THE GRASS. AND SO WE ARE ALL CONNECTED IN THE GREAT CIRCLE OF LIFE.

SIMBA: HEH HEH. YOU’RE SO WEIRD.
SCAR: YOU HAVE NO IDEA. ...SO, YOUR FATHER SHOWED YOU THE WHOLE KINGDOM, DID HE?
SIMBA: EVERYTHING.
SCAR: HE DIDN'T SHOW YOU WHAT'S BEYOND THAT RISE AT THE NORTHERN BORDER...?
SIMBA: {DISAPPOINTED} WELL, NO... HE SAID I CAN'T GO THERE.
SCAR: AND HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT! IT'S FAR TOO DANGEROUS. ONLY THE BRAVEST LIONS GO THERE.
SIMBA: WELL, I'M BRAVE! WHAT'S OUT TH--
SCAR: {INTERRUPTING} NO, I'M SORRY SIMBA; I JUST CAN'T TELL YOU.
SIMBA: WHY NOT?
SCAR: SIMBA, SIMBA; I'M ONLY LOOKING OUT FOR THE WELL-BEING OF MY FAVORITE NEPHEW.
SIMBA: {SNORTS SARCASTICALLY} YEAH, RIGHT; I'M YOUR ONLY NEPHEW.
SCAR: ALL THE MORE REASON FOR ME TO BE PROTECTIVE... AN ELEPHANT GRAVEYARD IS NO PLACE FOR A YOUNG PRINCE ... {FAKING SURPRISE} OOPS!

SIMBA: I NEED TO FIND NALA AND TELL HER THE SECRET.
MUCONDA: TELL NALA WHAT SECRET?

SIMBA: WELL WHEN I'M KING, THAT’LL BE THE FIRST THING TO GO. ZAZU: NOT SO LONG AS I'M AROUND.
{START FADING IN INTRO TO “I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO BE KING”} SIMBA: WELL IN THAT CASE, YOU'RE FIRED.
ZAZU: HMMM.... NICE TRY, BUT ONLY THE KING CAN DO THAT.
 
NALA: WELL, HE'S THE FUTURE KING.
SIMBA: YEAH. {THUMPING ZAZU'S CHEST} SO YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT I TELL YOU.
ZAZU: NOT YET I DON'T. AND WITH AN ATTITUDE LIKE THAT, I'M AFRAID YOU’RE SHAPING UP TO BE A PRETTY PATHETIC KING INDEED.
SIMBA: HMPH. NOT THE WAY I SEE IT. JUST CAN’T WAIT TO BE KING

### HOW TO USE:

*You might use python instead of python3.*
1. python3 auto_sub_solver.py; This can be used for quick, simple encoded messages.
2. python3 auto_sub_solver.py --clean; This is generally better and helps accuracy.
3. python3 auto_sub_solver.py --clean -r RESTARTS -i ITERATIONS. This helps fine tune; Generally longer texts need less restarts and iterations.
4. python3 auto_sub_solver.py --clean -r RESTARTS -i ITERATIONS --file file.txt; This can be used for long files, like when I decoded the US constitution. You edit file.txt first.
5. python3 auto_sub_solver.py --clean -r RESTARTS -i ITERATIONS --file file.txt --lambda LAMBDA; Higher emphasizes how much weight is given to words.
6. python3 auto_sub_solver.py --clean -r RESTARTS -i ITERATIONS --file file.txt --lambda LAMBDA --ignore WHAT,TO,IGNORE
