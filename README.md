# PicarX
_I am using the Sunfounder PicarX with a Rasberry Pi 5._

The Mahler file is not in this repository, but is a recording of Pierre Boulez conducting Mahler Symphony No. 6.

The purpose of this is to interact with the PicarX.

I have found it is pretty good at chess, but starts forgetting position in the middlegame.
