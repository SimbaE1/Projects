# PicarX
_I am using the Sunfounder PicarX with a Rasberry Pi 5._

The Mahler file is not in this repository, but is a recording of Pierre Boulez conducting Mahler Symphony No. 6.

The purpose of this is to interact with the PicarX.

I have found it is pretty good at chess, but starts forgetting position in the middlegame.

DOES NOT WORK - FOR NOW

# Decoder

DOES WORK

Give it an alphabet substitution or ceaser cipher and it will figure it out. Preferably 200+ char. Try not to use names or urls, as that trips it up for now.

EXAMPLE:
python3 auto_sub_solver.py --clean -r 150 -i 12000 "Ejiiv. C ictj lv ovwj, mv C dnwj lecm ocbejk wjovwjk. Cl cm kjniiz ovvi, cq cl hvktm.

===== Decryption =====

HELLO. I LIKE TO CODE, SO I MADE THIS CIPHER DECODER. IT IS REALLY COOL, IF IT WORKS. I HAVE TRIED THIS BEFORE, BUT IT SEEMS THIS IS A MUCH SHORTER AND BETTER APPROACH. IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO USE A PYTHON LIBRARY TO SEE IF THE TEXT MAKES SENSE, WHICH WOULD IMPROVE ACCURACY.
